> Problem: I like Wordle, but I want to remember my "stats" and compare myself to others.

> Solution: A leaderboard for the big Wordle fans!

## Background

I've been wanting to get back into building side-projects. In fact it was one of my <Link to="/">new years goals</Link>

## Step 1: Find a starter

> Problem: I want to find a stack I can go back to again and again as I start new projects.

Before I started at my current company I was toying around with React, Vue, Firebase, Supabase, AWS Lambda... the list goes on. This time I've decided to pick a stack and stick with it. Maybe I'll even open-source or sell my starter if I think it's valuable enough in the future. I'm confident I got this idea from [@VicVijayakumar](https://twitter.com/VicVijayakumar) on the [Virtual Coffee Podcast S1:E4](https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0104-vic-vijayakumar/). I landed on this [Vue + Supabase starter](https://github.com/zernonia/supabase-vue-3). It's been pretty amazing so far. 

### Step 2: Get started

I have an idea and I have the starter code. So I set up a project on [Supabase](https://supabase.io) and got to work. So far I have users, profile pages, the ability to paste in your puzzle solution, and it will show you the puzzles you've submitted. You can see a more detailed list on this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/pickleat/status/1483884580390281225?s=20).


### Next Steps

I'll plan on writing short addendums as I release new features... like the actual leaderboard. For now, please sign up at [WordleNerds.com](https://wordlenerds.com) if you want to join in on the fun!
