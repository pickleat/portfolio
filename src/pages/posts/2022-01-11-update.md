# Goal Progress

I made good progress in the first month of the year. Here's how it shook out:

### Ship Side-Projects & Blog More

I decided on my first side-project. A Wordle Leaderboard. If you haven't played Wordle, its a word-game where you have 6 chances to guess a five-letter word. Upon each guess, the letters not in the word will be grey-ed out, the letters in the word will be shown as yellow if they are in a different location or green if they are in the correct location. I want a way for people to show how many days they've done and how high on the leaderboard they are. If you want to check it out you can see the progress over on [WordleNerds.com](https://WordleNerds.com) and sign up for an account.

### Reading

["The Obstacle is the Way" by Ryan Holiday](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358/). The last passage I read was about coming at problems from a different angle. I think this is so powerful in a number of ways. I'll probably write up my overall thoughts, when I complete it. 


### Continue Working Out

I've been doing it! And feeling good as a result. 

No big call to action, but if you want to give me feedback or more generally keep up with me, I'm most active on twitter [@pickleat](https://twitter.com/pickleat).

P.S. I know I should fix the table with my progress but I just don't have time today.
