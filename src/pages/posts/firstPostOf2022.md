# Resolutions or Goals? 

Time for some goal-setting for the New Year. Some people make "resolutions" but I set goals, instead of "resolutions". James Clear says, "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become." I love this because it is TRUE. If you workout one time, you are a person who "worked out" not someone who "works out" or cares about their fitness. So I make goals of the person I want to become, instead of "resolutions."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3 ideas to start your year:<br><br>1) You don&#39;t rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.<br><br>2) Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.<br><br>3) Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p>&mdash; James Clear (@JamesClear) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1477686252333903877?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Goals for 2022

1. Continue working out regularly.
2. Read before bed.
3. Ship Side Projects/Blog More.

All fairly straight-forward. But the context is key, here's more on those goals.

### Continue Working Out

In September of 2021, my health insurance and [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/) decided to offer free one-year memberships to the app. I took them up on it, because "why not?". It was free and I had nothing to lose. I signed up, and saw they have all sorts of different classes aside from Cycling/Running. I tried strength, Yoga, and HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) classes and really enjoyed the 10 minute HIIT classes. I kept doing it for the rest of the year, a 1-3 times a week. My goal this year is to simply **KEEP** doing that. Do I want to improve and push myself to work out for more time and more often? Absolutely! But that's not my main goal, I want to be a person who "works out". I'm going to set my bar at an achievable level and go from there.

### Read Before Bed

My wife has made a goal to read more. I like reading, but I don't make the time for it. I *used* to read before bed, and quit sometime around having our baby early last year. I couldn't keep the light on in our room because the baby was sleeping there so I just stopped reading. That excuse is gone now, with the baby is sleeping soundly through the night, in her crib, in her room. I can keep the light on and read before bed again, so I am. First, I'm going to finish ["The Obstacle is the Way" by Ryan Holiday](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358/). I started it awhile back, but I'm going to finish it. I'm also reading a Star Wars book my wife bought me awhile back. Always been a big Star Wars fan, but never ventured into the books. We'll see if I enjoy it.

### Ship Side-Projects & Blog More

When I was learning to code I was always working on *something*. When I started to take on freelance work and doing frontend development professionally I started to have less free time. I have a freelance client that is wrapping up soon, so I want to get back into shipping side-projects. Mostly to learn more, pushing myself to improve at my job. And like many out there, I'd love to make money from a side-project. But setting aside that desire, I mostly want to make cool stuff. And the reason for blogging more? To hold myself accountable to what I'm doing. I may have a technical post here and there, I may only have personal updates. Or maybe I'll start sharing my [lego builds](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/rt5n42/the_child_first_build_since_i_was_a_kid_loved/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) here.

No big call to action, but if you want to give me feedback or more generally keep up with me, I'm most active on twitter [@pickleat](https://twitter.com/pickleat).
