I decided to repost it on my blog, since I wrote it and all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For my first post I thought I'd share a short little trick I learned that makes websites look better!  </p>\n<p>For starters, if you don't know what a favicon is, don't fret! I didn't until recently. Its the small thumbnail on your tab. If you use Google Chrome, it looks like this: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pickleat/dev.to/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%201.22.49%20PM.png\" alt=\"Example of Website Favicons\"></p>\n<p>I've been working on a project1 for CS50 for web-programming class. The assignment: build a book review website, using Flask and PostgreSQL. While I was working on it, I got bit miffed that my site wasn't looking very professional. I was using Bootstrap, for the ease of formatting, but that wasn't looking great, just a tad better than the default. I decided adding a favicon would help a bit, but I didn't want to mess with making a logo or finding a picture and scaling it, so I thought. Maybe an emoji would work? It did, fantastically! </p>\n<p>I decided it would be painless to find the emoji I wanted and then just add it to my <code>&#x3C;head></code> of my template.html. Here's how the code ended up looking:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pickleat/dev.to/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%201.34.58%20PM.png\" alt=\"Code Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>This adds a great touch, and if a user is like me and has 15 tabs open at all times, the favicon, would help them find the correct page.</p>\n<p>Here's how I did it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Head to <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/\">emojipedia.org</a></li>\n<li>Find your emoji.</li>\n<li>Right-Click on the emoji style you prefer (I chose the Apple version)</li>\n<li>Copy the link and insert into your <code>&#x3C;head></code> tag like so: <code>&#x3C;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/apple/155/books_1f4da.png\"></code> OR if you are using <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a> you can download the file and save as <code>favicon.ico</code> into your static folder and it will inject it for you!.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And you're done! I was using flask for this project, so I put this in the layout page and it dynamically puts in on any template that has the <code>{% extends \"layout.html\" %}</code> at the top of the .html doc.</p>\n<p>Here's how it looks!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pickleat/dev.to/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%201.36.46%20PM.png\" alt=\"Look at the icon in the tab!\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, I'm still testing on a localhost, haven't quite finished the project yet, but it'll be on my <a href=\"https://pickleat.github.io/\">profile site</a>, and its own <a href=\"https://github.com/pickleat/BookReviewSite\">repo</a> as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for reading!
